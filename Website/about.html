        Our damnation: it obsessed the sodden dead, dominating their bubbling dialogues. They spoke of a heaven, where once we all lived and died, sentenced for our sins to this pandemonium we call the world. Truly, life is hell and death's rough hand our only deliverance.

        I am going to look at the stars. They are so far away and their light takes so long to reach us. All we ever see of stars are their old photographs. I am two hundred and twenty-seven million kilometers from the sun. It's light is already ten minutes old. It will not reach Pluto for another two hours... I am watching the stars. Halley's Comet tumbles through the solar system on its great seventy-six-year ellipse.
